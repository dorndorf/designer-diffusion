Time-Travelling Designers with AI

This repository contains the code and resources used in the blog article "Time-Travelling Designers with AI." In this article, we explore the creative possibilities of generative AI models by reimagining iconic designers' works in different time periods and fields.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo

We have provided a simple interactive demo using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) in the `demo.py` script. This demo allows you to experience how the AI models can generate designs inspired by legendary designers in various scenarios. To run the demo, use the following command:

```bash
python demo.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to explore the "time-travelling" designers' creative potential.

## Usage

You can use the code and resources in this repository as a starting point for your own experiments with generative AI models and design. Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs.
